# What is Rolling-TextView?
As name indicates Rolling text is an Android UI animation given to text view, in which number scrolls one after other in an incremental order. The idea of animation is to give a feel of scrolling number which we ususally gets to see on petrol pump's display. The number starts rolling from 0 and ends on a number which has to be displayed.

Like 2345 will start animating from 0000--->2345. Currently we are supporting numbers only for animation.

# Customizations:
1. We can have animation on any number of text views, if we enter two numbers(56) the two text fields will be created dynamically.
2. We can customize the font size and style of the text view.
3. We can customize the animation duration.
4. We can increase or decrease the gap between two animating text views.

# Use:
1. We can use this animation while validating otp numbers.
2. This can be used in any number display UI.
